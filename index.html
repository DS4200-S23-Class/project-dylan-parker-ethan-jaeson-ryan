        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            This project addresses a situation where students wish to research a new
            scientific subject by collecting a well-informed list of scientific
            articles to read through a Google Scholar query.
        </p>
        <p>
            The problem with such a
            query is that Google Scholar search results are simple and linear,
            preventing the student from comparing results across content metrics or
            discovering contextual relations between papers. This means that the
            students must select papers to read based on less information and
            considering, potentially reducing the quality and effectiveness of their
            research.
        </p>
        <p>
            Conversely, since research is the first step in learning a new
            subject, improving this process could quickly improve a student’s
            interest and understanding of a novel subject matter. This tool aid in
            such research by presenting the results of a Google Scholar search in
            both a network and scatterplot embedding. The resulting scatterplot's axes
            can be adjusted based on user preference. Also, papers can be
            clicked on and hovered over to reveal further information such as Authors
            and Abstract, which can expedite the process of selecting papers for further review.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            This tool visualizes information about the search results of a specific
            Google Scholar query (in the case of our example visual, the query is
            “epigenetic profiling in single cells”). This included the title,
            abstract, number of citations, number of authors, year of publication,
            venue, and more. Importantly, each paper also has a list of papers that
            cite it, which is pivotal to creating the citation network
            visualization. The ordinal metrics are visualized on a
            scatterplot, with adjustable axes based on user selection.

        </p>
        <p> The data was scraped from the Google Scholar webpage using ScholarlyAPI and
            ScaperAPI. Web scraping is a complicated ethical issue, since most
            websites do not encourage automatic scraping efforts. We tried to
            mitigate traffic concerns by using the ScraperAPI, which incorporated
            automated delays on each query. The data is significantly biased towards
            Google Scholar’s search algorithm, since we scrape the top 200 search
            results from that webpage alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of data quality, some of the
            venues of publication, such as Nature, have extraneous symbols and
            characters added to the end of their titles, which need to be removed to
            show the real name. Also, the page count is in a string format and
            sometimes includes letters or dashes, so these values need to be removed
            and cast into integers in order to calculate the page length.
