            <h1> Visualizing connections between scientific publications using networks and embeddings </h1>
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                This project addresses a situation where students wish to research a new
                scientific subject by collecting a well-informed list of scientific
                articles to read through a Google Scholar query.
                The problem with such a
                query is that Google Scholar search results are simple and linear,
                preventing the student from comparing results across content metrics or
                discovering contextual relations between papers. This means that the
                students must select papers to read based on less information and
                considering, potentially reducing the quality and effectiveness of their
                research.
                Conversely, since research is the first step in learning a new
                subject, improving this process could quickly improve a student’s
                interest and understanding of a novel subject matter. This tool aid in
                such research by presenting the results of a Google Scholar search in
                both a network and scatterplot embedding. The resulting scatterplot's axes
                can be adjusted based on user preference. Also, papers can be
                clicked on and hovered over to reveal further information such as Authors
                and Abstract, which can expedite the process of selecting papers for further review.

            </p>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
                This tool visualizes information about the search results of a specific Google Scholar query (in the
                case of our example visual, the query is “epigenetic profiling in single cells”). This included the
                title, abstract, number of citations, number of authors, year of publication, venue, and more.
                Each paper has a list of papers it cites and papers that cite it, which are used to create the
                citation network visualization. The ordinal metrics are visualized on a scatterplot, with adjustable
                axes based on user selection.

            </p>

            <h3> Data</h3>
            <p>
                The data was scraped from the Google Scholar webpage using ScholarlyAPI and ScaperAPI. Web scraping
                is a complicated ethical issue, since most websites do not encourage automatic scraping efforts. We
                tried to
                mitigate traffic concerns by using the ScraperAPI, which incorporated automated delays on each
                query. The data is significantly biased towards Google Scholar’s search algorithm, since we scrape
                the top 200 search
                results from that webpage alone. In terms of data quality, some of the venues of publication, such
                as Nature, have extraneous symbols and characters added to the end of their titles, which need to be
                removed to
                show the real name. Also, the page count is in a string format and sometimes includes letters or
                dashes, so these values need to be removed and cast into integers in order to calculate the page
                length.
