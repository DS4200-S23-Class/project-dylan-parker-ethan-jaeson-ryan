00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.660
So, this visualization gives you two different 
ways to analyze the search results of a Google  

2
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.240
Scholar query. You can analyze the papers 
based on content or based on context.  

3
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.000
So, here we can see a sample query: 
"epigenetic profiling in single cells",  

4
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.040
and here are the results from Google 
Scholar. So, this is the content approach,  

5
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:34.260
and it is a scatter plot that allows you to select 
a quality of the paper and analyze each of the  

6
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.520
papers based on that quality and see if there's 
any outliers - in the case here there is an  

7
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.460
outlier - and based on the results you can click 
on - you can hover to see some information about  

8
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.840
the paper, and then you can click to actually get 
the abstract and read more and figure out if it's  

9
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.800
something you want to actually read the entire 
paper of. If you do, you can just copy the results  

10
00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.420
from last selected paper. This also allows you to 
notice that there's trends in results, such as the  

11
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:10.740
citations per year and the publication year having 
a correlation, or the citations per year and the  

12
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.340
number of citations would, of course, have a 
pretty distinct correlation. Now for context,  

13
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.100
this network graph puts all the papers in a 
network, where they're connected based on whether  

14
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.120
or not they cite each other. You can see here 
that there's an arrow denoting which paper cites  

15
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.060
the other and so you can see that this paper is 
actually pretty central to the network, cited by  

16
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.640
13 other papers, and so then you can click on 
that paper and see more information about it.  

17
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.500
Noticeably, when you select a paper here, 
it's highlighted in orange. That same paper  

18
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.640
will also be highlighted in orange up here, 
so you can then look at more content related  

19
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.520
results by clicking up above. Those are the 
two major functions of the visualization. We  

20
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.200
think that it can help you when researching a new 
subject and selecting papers for further research.
